    "This notebook is meant to be used when you are studing a complex that contains at least two or more proteins because it is meant to generate a report on the residues of a protein chain of interest that interacts with another in a structure and tell you what parts of the chain of interest have equivalents in a remote homolog. This notebook illustrates bringing together the structural data from a released structure with a remote homology alignment by tools from HH-Suite3. The idea is you may have a protein where the structure has been solved and if that chain has been used to identify remote homologs, you may be curious about whether residues involved in interacting with other chains in the complex are found in the identified homolog and what are the identities.\n",
