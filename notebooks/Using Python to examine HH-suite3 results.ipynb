Saving in that form may seem odd, but as illustrated [here](#Output-to-more-universal,-table-like-formats) below this is is a very malleable form. And even more pertinent for dealing with data in Jupyter notebooks, there is actually an easier way to interact with this script when in Jupyter notebook that skips saving this intermediate file. So hang on through the long, more trandtional way of doing this before the easier way is introduced. And I saved it in the compact form and not the mroe typical tab-delimited form because we mostly won't go this route and might as well make tiny files while working along to a better route. It is easy to convert back and forth using the pickled form assuming you can match the Pandas/Python versions.)\n",

    "Note that this script keeps each hit as a separate entry in the resulting dataframe. The biopython hhsuite parser also demonstrated in this Jupyter notebook below makes a text table that combines 'high-scoring segment pair' or 'high-scoring pair' (hsp) that correspond to the same accession identifier. You could always use Panda's `groupby` in a downstream step to achieve a similar accounting with `hhsuite3_results_to_df.py`. Here is an example where the 32 rows collapse to sixteen sets of two if you group by the hit indentifier. For example, if you scroll up you'll notice hit_nums #8 & #9 are associated with the same identifier, which is 1en2_A. Those become a group at the top of this way of grouping:"

    "We obtained the `hhsuite3_results_to_df.py` script in the preparation steps above. However, instead of using it as an external script as we did earlier in this notebook, we want to use the core function of that script within this notebook for the options that involve no file intermediatess. Similar to the way we imported a lot of other useful modules in the first notebook and a cell above, you can run the next cell to bring in to memory of this notebook's computational environment, the main function associated with the `hhsuite3_results_to_df.py` script, aptly named `hhsuite3_results_to_df`. (As written below the command to do that looks a bit redundant;however, the first from part of the command below actually is referencing the `hhsuite3_results_to_df.py` script, but it doesn't need the `.py` extension because the import only deals with such files.)"

(With some additional resources from [an older tutotial](https://biopython-cn.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/en/chr08.html).) Beyond that I had to work out some of this with trial-and-error because I was not overly familiar with the HSP and HSPFragment modules within Biopython. I've added the use of `dir()` at the end here to explore what attributes are available; however, I liked looking at the resources listed above to get a sense of how thos related to the parsed results file and Biopython."
