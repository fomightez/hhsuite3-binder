    "The previous notebook, [Report if residues interacting with a specific chain have equivalent residues in an hhsuite-generated alignment](Report%20if%20residues%20interacting%20with%20a%20specific%20chain%20have%20equivalent%20residues%20in%20an%20hhsuite-generated%20alignment.ipynb), stepped through making reports whether residues in a chain that interact with a specific other chain are conserved in a related alignment generated by HH-suite3 software. \n",
    "Is there a way to scale this up to make reports for many combinations of chains in several pairs of related structures or even unrelated structures? This may be especially helpful for the cases where the structures involved are large complexes and several versions of the structure were solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook spells out a way to do this with minimal effort. In fact, you only really need knowledge of the PDB code identifiers of the structures you are interested in, the chain designations in each structure, and the name of alignment file. You'll fill out a table to define the structures, chains, & alignments, and then kick off the process and make Jupyter notebooks containing the reports on conservation within the provided alignments for the residues from the specified structures and chains. Snakemake is used to run the process seen in the previous notebooks as a pipeling to do the analysis for multiple combinations specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snakemake is used here as a workflow management software; however, the wonderful features it provides aren't fully covered or demonstrated. I did use a distinct and simpler workflow, to provide more background to using Snakemake in the notebook 'Making multiple interface-reporting dataframes for several structures using snakemake' available when you go [here](https://github.com/fomightez/pdbepisa-binder) and click `launch binder`. That Jupyter notebook also suggests further resources for learning Snakemake.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step #1:** Make a table with columns separated by spaces and each line as a row. Each row will specify a structure,two chains from the structure, and an alignment from HH-suite3-related software where the first chain was the query, and the hit number in that alignment to check for the equivalent residues in the hit sequence, for a total of five required items per line. If your query and homolog are the best hit, they'll be the first one and the number to use in the last required enry will be `1`. This is expexted to be the tpyical case. Optionally, in the lines of the matrix you can also specify whether the details of the residues with equivalents should be included in the report, and  whether the details of the residues without equivalents should be included in the report. Those two settings default to `True` and `False` if left off and just five items are given per line in the 'equiv_check_matrix.txt' table. Seven items will occur on lines where all variables are provided.    \n",

Using one core avoids that hazard. I will add though that in most cases if you use multiple cores, you can easily get the additional files and a new archive made by running snakemake with your chosen number of cores again.  I never saw a race hazard with my clean rule, and so if you want to quickly start over you can run `!snakemake -s equiv_snakefile --cores 8 clean`.)"
